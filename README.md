The project's focal element is a dynamic sphere, which undergoes color changes corresponding to the cursor's position on the screen, rooted in the XY quadrants. This interactive feature not only showcases responsive visual alterations but also showcases the project's utilization of GSAP for smooth animations. Additionally, the sphere's orientation can be controlled through orbit controls, enhancing the user's engagement with the prototype.

In essence, "Give it a Spin" encapsulates the integration of cutting-edge web technologies, offering a tangible example of interactive 3D graphics through its innovative utilization of Three.js and GSAP, even in the absence of extensive functionalities.
